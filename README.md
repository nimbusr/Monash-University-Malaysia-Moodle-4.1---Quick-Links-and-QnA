It's possible that the error occurred because your actions were too rigorous during the migration. It's a good idea to find a balance between thoroughness and avoiding unintended consequences. In this case, moving the page backward and redoing it seems to have resolved the issue.

<summary> <b>Q:</b> Why are H5Ps appearing on my assessment page, even though they shouldn't be? </summary>
<br> <b>A:</b>
This is happening because some of your H5Ps are currently set to have a graded value. By default, graded activities show up on the assessment page.

To fix this, follow these steps:<br> 

-- Go to the "Gradebook setup" section. <br> 
-- Identify the H5Ps that are causing the issue. <br> 
-- Change the weight of each H5P to 0%. This essentially removes their grading value.<br> 

Once you've adjusted the weight for all relevant H5Ps, the assessment page should no longer display them.

<summary> <b>Q:</b> How can I rearrange items within a section to adjust their order? </summary>
<br> <b>A:</b>
To rearrange items within a section to adjust their order in Moodle, follow these steps: <br>

-- Hover over any activity block within the section.<br>
-- You will notice crosshairs appearing; use them to grab the activity block. <br>
-- Drag the block to the desired position within the section. <br>
-- Drop the block in its new position to rearrange the items. <br>
However, please note that this feature may not work for activities in the "Overview" section. In such cases, you will need to use the mass actions block to move items. Additionally, ensure that there is content present in the destination subsection for seamless movement across subsections.
