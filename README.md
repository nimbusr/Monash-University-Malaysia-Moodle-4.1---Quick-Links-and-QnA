It's possible that the error occurred because your actions were too rigorous during the migration. It's a good idea to find a balance between thoroughness and avoiding unintended consequences. In this case, moving the page backward and redoing it seems to have resolved the issue.

Yes, you could place the graded weekly exercise at the end of your lesson plan, in the "wrap-up" section and they will show in the assessment summary table.
