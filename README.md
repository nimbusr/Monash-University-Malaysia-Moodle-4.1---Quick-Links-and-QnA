It's possible that the error occurred because your actions were too rigorous during the migration. It's a good idea to find a balance between thoroughness and avoiding unintended consequences. In this case, moving the page backward and redoing it seems to have resolved the issue.

Yes, you could place the graded weekly exercise at the end of your lesson plan, in the "wrap-up" section and they will show in the assessment summary table.

<summary> <b>Q:</b> Why are H5Ps appearing on my assessment page, even though they shouldn't be? </summary>
<br> <b>A:</b>
This is happening because some of your H5Ps are currently set to have a graded value. By default, graded activities show up on the assessment page.

To fix this, follow these steps:<br> 

-- Go to the "Gradebook setup" section. <br> 
-- Identify the H5Ps that are causing the issue. <br> 
-- Change the weight of each H5P to 0%. This essentially removes their grading value.<br> 

Once you've adjusted the weight for all relevant H5Ps, the assessment page should no longer display them.
